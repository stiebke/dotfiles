# stiebke's dotfiles

My configuration. Minimalist, but helps save a few thousand keystrokes a day. I use macOS, so I can only guarantee they'll work on a Mac, but I use some of these dotfiles on various linux servers, and they seem to be pretty flexible.

You may also be interested in my fork of [Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/stiebke/mac-dev-playbook) by [Jeff Geerling](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook), which configures a Mac from scratch using Ansible, and incorporates the installation and updating of a set of dotfiles like this one.

This repo is based on the work of [geerlingguy's dotfiles](https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles) by Jeff Geerling.
